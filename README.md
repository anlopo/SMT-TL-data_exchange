Data exchange between [ScanMyTesla](https://www.scanmytesla.com/) and [TeslaLogger](https://github.com/bassmaster187/TeslaLogger), with example PHP scripts that log the data.

The ScanMyTesla code that sends data was written by the author of TeslaLogger. The author of ScanMyTesla doesnâ€™t want to modify that code, not even to add a text box to change the server where the data is sent.

When in ScanMyTesla is TeslaLogger token set:
* POST request to https://teslalogger.de/check_token.php is send:
```logfile
    Time: 2025-02-09 16:29:40
    IP: 192.168.10.113
    Method: POST
    URL: /check_token.php
    Headers:
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Host: teslalogger.de
    User-Agent: Dalvik/2.1.0 (Linux; U; Android 7.0; SM-A310F Build/NRD90M)
    Content-Length: 12
    Accept-Encoding: identity
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    Body:
    t=TOKEN
```

    (curl -X POST "https://teslalogger.de/check_token.php" -H "Connection: Keep-Alive" -H "Host: teslalogger.de" -H "User-Agent: Dalvik/2.1.0 (Linux; U; Android 7.0; SM-A310F Build/NRD90M)" -H "Accept-Encoding: identity" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --data "t=TOKEN")

    token 00000000 can be used for testing, from TeslaLogger source it seem that this token is used for testing

* Response can be:
  * "not found"
  * "Resource Limit Is Reached" (maybe?)
  * "ERROR: ..." (maybe?)
  * "OK"

* If OK is recived then ScanMyTesla start sending data to https://teslalogger.de/insert_scanmytesla.php as POST request:
  * Body tokens: t="token" v="version?" m="json data in Percent-encoding format"

    "444": 6.3000000000000007
  }
}
```

JSON keys meaning from the TeslaLogger source:
```
key d: datetime
key dict.2: SMTCellTempAvg
key dict.5: SMTCellMinV
key dict.6: SMTCellAvgV
key dict.7: SMTCellMaxV
key dict.9: SMTACChargeTotal
key dict.11: SMTDCChargeTotal
key dict.27: SMTCellImbalance
key dict.28: SMTBMSmaxCharge
key dict.29: SMTBMSmaxDischarge
key dict.43: SMTBatteryPower
key dict.71: SMTNominalFullPack
key dict.442: SMTSpeed (if value is 287.6 then Sihnel is not avalible)
ScanMyTesla sends a lot more data, but TeslaLogger (as of the code state on 2025-02-09) saves only the keys listed above.
```

* The TeslaLogger server (teslalogger.de) stores the data, and according to the ScanMyTesla webpage, "Data will be deleted immediately after being downloaded to your Teslalogger".
  * A TeslaLogger instance sends a POST request with a token to http://teslalogger.de/get_scanmytesla.php, where it probably receives the data in the same format as ScanMyTesla sends.
